      </h2>
      <p>
        As a child of young parents, I was conceived by accident and kept a
        secret until the end of the pregnancy. So, I spent nine months
        marinating in my mother’s fear, guilt, and shame of being pregnant and
        unwed. My grandparents raised me, and despite the love and care I
        received, the absence of my parents was painful and left me feeling
        undesired, rejected, and not worthy of their love and presence. So, I
        grew up feeling lonely, uncertain, left out, and crippled by
        frustration, anger, confusion, sadness, and unworthiness.To cope, I
        simply buried my feelings and shut off. It wasn’t until I became
        pregnant with my first child that I understood the importance of
        HEALING. I wanted to clear my own childhood traumas before bringing a
        child to the world. The healing session was AMAZING, and I became
        inspired and eager to learn the modality, so that I can share the same
        wonderful feeling with others.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve been involved with healing since 2004 when I participated in a two
        year training in healing and clairvoyance at the Institute of Personal
        Development by Tom Stern and Sissel Maya Øster. Here I learned several
        healing techniques, and I got all three Reiki inaugurations. ​In 2005 I
        took a basic course in Quantum Touch (physical pain and damage) by
        Edward Vise in Sweden. In 2006, I attended 2-days workshop in sound
        healing the Soul Voice® method by Karina Schelde, which paved the way
        for my self development and progress, from all walks of life into full
        realisation of my potential and life vision. Shortly after the workshop
        I travelled to India for some months and really gave myself time to
        sense, what the two day workshop had given me. I became more and more
        curious to explore Soul Voice® method. After I had returned from India,
        I resigned myself to Karina Scheldes 5-day course “Soul Voice® Sound
        Advanced Initiation”
