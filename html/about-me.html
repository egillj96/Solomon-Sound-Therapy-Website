            My personal
            <span class="higlightSpan"> path to healing</span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            As a child of young parents, I was conceived by accident and kept a
            secret until the end of the pregnancy. So, I spent nine months
            marinating in my mother’s fear, guilt, and shame of being pregnant
            and unwed.
          </p>
          <p>
            My grandparents raised me, and despite the love and care I received,
            the absence of my parents was painful and left me feeling undesired,
            rejected, and not worthy of their love and presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I grew up feeling lonely, uncertain, left out, and crippled by
            frustration, anger, confusion, sadness, and unworthiness.To cope, I
            simply buried my feelings and shut off.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t until I became pregnant with my first child that I
            understood the importance of HEALING. I wanted to clear my own
            childhood traumas before bringing a child to the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The healing session was AMAZING, and I became inspired and eager to
            learn the modality, so that I can share the same wonderful feeling
            with others.

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve been involved with healing since 2004 when I participated in a
            two year training in healing and clairvoyance at the Institute of
            Personal Development by Tom Stern and Sissel Maya Øster.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here I learned several healing techniques, and I got all three Reiki
            inaugurations.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2005 I took a basic course in Quantum Touch (physical pain and
            damage) by Edward Vise in Sweden.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2006, I attended 2-days workshop in sound healing the Soul Voice®
            method by Karina Schelde, which paved the way for my self
            development and progress, from all walks of life into full
            realisation of my potential and life vision.
          </p>

          <p>
            Shortly after the workshop I travelled to India for some months and
            really gave myself time to sense, what the two day workshop had
            given me. I became more and more curious to explore Soul Voice®
            method.
          </p>

          <p>
            After I had returned from India, I resigned myself to Karina
            Scheldes 5-day course “Soul Voice® Sound Advanced Initiation”
